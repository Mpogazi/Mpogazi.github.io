				Fabrice Bigabiro Mpogazi is a Rwandan student at Tufts University, majoring in Computer Science. Fabrice was born and raised in a traditional Rwandan family. He attended primary school in the outskirts of Kigali. After the primary school, Fabrice attended Byimana School of Sciences, one of the best public schools in Rwanda. During his time in Byimana, he focused on sciences, mainly Physics, Mathematics, and Chemistry. This high school foundation cements his interests in science, innovation, and technology, which are his main area of academic and professional interests. After high school, a gap-year program in Rwanda noticed his potential and dedication to acamedics, and decided to admit him in their preparatory program, where he earned a full scholarship to Tufts University in Medford, United States.
