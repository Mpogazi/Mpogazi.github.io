			<p>Hello, Welcome to my profile!</p>
			<p>
			For those who do not know me, I am Fabrice Bigabiro Mpogazi, a student at 
			Tufts University. I am hopefully majoring 
			in Computer Science. I am a computer enthusiast. I will spend all night 
			trying to make games, go nearly late to class with red eyes. But, it's just 
			for the love of what I do. 
			I pride myself of problem solving skills and googling skills.
			In addition, I know where stuff are on stackoverflow.

			Much love,
			Fabrice
