Each day, we face urgent demands that seem crucial at the moment, but we quickly forget them once they are completed. In this constant hustle, we rarely pause to break the monotony and reflect on life as a whole. We seldom ask ourselves profound questions like, why are we here? What is happening in the infinite universe around us? These questions are essential for a deeper understanding of our existence, yet they often get lost in the rush of our daily routines.\nIt doesn’t end there. We also tend to accept many things as the norm without questioning them. For instance, we accept death as a routine occurrence, and we come to terms with aging and the suffering it brings. We resign ourselves to the limitations of our bodies, such as our inability to regrow limbs when they are damaged. These are just a few of the profound realities we rarely challenge or seek to change, despite their significant impact on our lives.\nI’m not comfortable with these accepted norms and have been formulating a plan to challenge them. Let me walk you through my high-level thinking. To begin, we need to address the primary obstacle to our scientific and technological progress: cheap intelligence. While humans are intelligent, curious, and capable of remarkable achievements, they also face significant limitations. They age, get tired, lose interest, and ultimately die, which hinders the continuous advancement of technology and science.\nThe solution lies in artificial intelligence. This doesn’t mean excluding humans from the equation. Instead, it involves developing tools that can greatly aid us in creating new technologies and making groundbreaking scientific discoveries. (Note that the limits of what is possible is set by the laws of physics, which with what we know so far allows for crazy stuff to be created.)\nBy leveraging such tools, we will solve biological limitations, such as death and aging, and scarcity as well. With those out of the way, we can focus on more ambitious goals, such as exploring space and understanding the point of existence. And this is where the real fun begins, because then we can pursue the ultimate goal of life itself.\nSummarized Plan: Develop AI to aid in scientific and technological advancements. Use AI to solve biological limitations and scarcity. Focus on exploring space and understanding the point of existence. Pursue the ultimate goal of life itself. That is Laugh Tale. Let’s find the One Piece together.\n",
